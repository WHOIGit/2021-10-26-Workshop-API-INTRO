  Data reuse saves time and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. By making your data open and available to others, 
  you make it possible for future researchers to answer questions that havenâ€™t yet been asked. 
  But <strong>how do you actually reuse the data that you put in repositories?</strong> 
</p>
<p>  
  This is a 4 hour workshop <strong>tailored to the ocean sciences</strong>. We aim to teach the basics of data reuse using ERDDAP servers maintained by ocean science specific repo's
  and programs: <a href="https://www.bco-dmo.org">BCO-DMO</a>, <a href="https://biogeochemical-argo.org/">BGC-Argo</a> and <a href="https://oceanobservatories.org">OOI</a>. 
  The processig environment where the data will be pulled in to is Python, but other programs such as R and Matlab
  can use of the same technology. There is no need to have background in API's, however some basic python understanding is necessary, using libraries and basics of the pandas library.
